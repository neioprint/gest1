QUICK START - GET YOUR WEBSITE LIVE IN MINUTES!

Ready to get started building your new website? With your HostPapa web hosting account, you can use any tools or software to build your website.

HostPapa offers several free and fee-based website building programs. This includes popular free tools, such as WordPress, Joomla!, and Drupal.

We highly recommend that you try out HostPapa’s own Website Builder tool. The Starter Edition is included with your web hosting package and allows you to create your first two pages absolutely free. No other software or website designer is needed - with a large library of professional templates, and an easy-to-use interface, you can get a professional website up and running in minutes. Best of all, you can do it yourself - no coding required! Simply activate and start using your Website Builder in your dashboard in the “My Website” tab.
